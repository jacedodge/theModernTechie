Capstone Project | E-Commerce Site:
This project was my first shot at building a website, and I loved every minute of it. I used mostly HTML and CSS with a sprinkle of some JS for menu functionality.
I really focused on layout and responsiveness while creating and manipulating classes with HTML, and learned some transtitions/effects with CSS.

Bugs: 
- Menu alignment incorrect for smaller screen sizes

Goals:
- I would love to integrate more JS functionality as I get a better handle on HTML & CSS. Most times I felt I tried to go above and beyond, the whole things came tumbling down.
- Better mobile responsiveness for select sections including the footer.
-JSON data retrieval. The ability to autofill current and new objects through a JSON database.
